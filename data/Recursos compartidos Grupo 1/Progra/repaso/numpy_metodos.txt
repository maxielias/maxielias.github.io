Sure, here are some key NumPy methods along with examples:

Creating arrays:

np.array([1, 2, 3]): creates a 1D array with values 1, 2, and 3.
np.zeros((2, 3)): creates a 2D array of size 2x3 with all elements initialized to 0.
np.ones((2, 3)): creates a 2D array of size 2x3 with all elements initialized to 1.
np.arange(0, 10, 2): creates a 1D array with values from 0 to 8 with a step size of 2.
Reshaping arrays:

arr.reshape((2, 3)): reshapes an array into a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
np.transpose(arr): transposes an array.
Mathematical operations:

np.add(arr1, arr2): adds two arrays element-wise.
np.subtract(arr1, arr2): subtracts two arrays element-wise.
np.multiply(arr1, arr2): multiplies two arrays element-wise.
np.divide(arr1, arr2): divides two arrays element-wise.
np.dot(arr1, arr2): computes the dot product of two arrays.
Statistical operations:

np.mean(arr): computes the mean of an array.
np.median(arr): computes the median of an array.
np.std(arr): computes the standard deviation of an array.
np.var(arr): computes the variance of an array.
Array indexing and slicing:

arr[2]: returns the element at index 2.
arr[1:3]: returns a slice of the array from index 1 to index 2 (exclusive).
arr[:3]: returns a slice of the array from the beginning to index 2 (exclusive).
arr[3:]: returns a slice of the array from index 3 to the end.
These are just a few examples of key NumPy methods, but there are many more. Let me know if you have any other questions!
